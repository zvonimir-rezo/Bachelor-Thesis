In this paper, an exploratory analysis of the data set containing data about tennis matches
was performed, and based on the features extracted from that data set, predictive models
were developed to predict the winner of a tennis match. The first chapter describes rules of
tennis and parts of statistical data analysis as well as statistical and machine learning models
used later in the paper. In the second part of the paper, previously described models are
developed and the results of predictions with various combinations of input variables are
presented.
